 * @brief     Fuzzy Logic functions
 * @details   <b>Fuzzy logic</b> is a design pattern for digital controllers.
 * The key principle is true/false conditions can take on a spectrum
 * of possibilities from definitely true (255) to definitely false (0).
 * For example, a fuzzy logic value of 128 means maybe.
 * Like any controller, a fuzzy logic controller: collects information
 * from input sensors, performs calculations, makes decisions, and affects
 * the system by outputting to actuators. Also similar to other controllers,
 * the goal is to drive the system into a desired state.
 * In a fuzzy logic controller,  <b>crisp inputs</b> are the sensor measurements
 * with units, and <b>crisp outputs</b> are the actuator commands with units.
 * A <b>fuzzy membership set</b> is a collection of variables, having values from<br>
 * true (255,254,253,...,2,1,0) false.<br>
 * The <b>input membership set</b> defines the status of the system, and the fuzzy values
 * are derived from the sensors. The <b>output membership set</b> defines the
 * status of the actuators, and the values describe what the controller
 * intends to do in order to drive the system into the desired state.
 * More specifically, a fuzzy logic performs these steps:<br>
 1) <b>Measurements</b>: collect <b>crisp inputs</b> from sensors. <br>
 2) <b>Fuzzification</b>: converts crisp inputs to input fuzzy variables.<br>
 3) <b>Fuzzy logic</b>: converts input fuzzy variables to output fuzzy variables. <br>
 4) <b>Defuzzification</b>: converts output fuzzy variables to actuator commands, and perform outputs.<br>
