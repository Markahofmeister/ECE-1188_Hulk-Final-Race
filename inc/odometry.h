 * @brief     Count wheel rotations and maintain robot position and angle
 * @details   Inputs to the system are left and right tachometer counts.
 * System is called periodically, e.g., every 20 to 40 ms.
 * Private global variables from the system are position (x,y) and orientation theta.

 * @warning   This system will need calibration to your particular robot, adjust N D W C for your robot
 * @date      July 31, 2019
 *
 * Although tested with the Pololu #3542 Romi Encoder connected to Pololu RSLK 1.1 interface board,
 * the module should operate with any 2 wheel differential drive robot.
