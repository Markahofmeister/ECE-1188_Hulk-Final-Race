/**
 * @file      BumpInt.h
 * @brief     Provide low-level functions that interface bump switches on the robot.
 * @details   Six switches are connected to P4.7-P4.5, P4.3, P4.2, and P4.0<br>
 1) Hardware uses negative logic with internal pullup<br>
 2) Positioned on the front of the robot to detect collisions<br>
 3) Software returns 6-bit positive logic (1 means collision)<br>
 4) Interrupt driven event handler
