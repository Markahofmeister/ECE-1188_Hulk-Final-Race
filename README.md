To get started, download the master branch and unzip the files if necessary. Open Code Composer Studio and import _Hulk_Master and inc as CCS projects. The other projects that start with an _underscore are test projects used to test different components and functionalities and are therefore optional. In code composer, in the file explorer, make sure that you can see both the _Hulk_Master and inc as folders. Finally, to flash the bot, make sure that you have selected the _Hulk_Master project and press the flash button. Congrats, you hopefully have successfully uploaded the race code to your bot!
